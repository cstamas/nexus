  <h2>Subversion</h2>
    
	<p>
	  If anyone wants to desperately see the source we're happy to provide it, but our infrastructure is not quite
	  ready to make the source for Nexus public. For the beta-2 release we plan to open up the Subversion repository so
	  people can take a look under the hood.
