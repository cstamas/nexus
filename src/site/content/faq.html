    <h2>Is Nexus the kingpin of all Maven repository managers?</h2>
    <p>Yes. Is that a trick question?</p>        
    
    <h2>Is Nexus commercial?</h2>
    <p>
      There is a GPL licensed version of Nexus, and there will be commercially licensed version of Nexus. 
      The open source version is very robust and will be the basis of our commercial version. 
      The commercial version of Nexus will be the open source base combined with additional plugins 
      adding functionality desirable to many enterprise users. Sonatype will be providing professional support 
      for both the open source and commercial versions of Nexus.
    </p>      
    
    <h2>Why are you releasing Nexus under the GPL?</h2>
    <p>
      There are a lot of Maven people involved at Sonatype, and normally we have used a BSD/MIT/Apache license 
      so some people have asked us why, oh why, did you choose the GPL? The answer is that we originally 
      intended there only be a commercial version of Nexus, but we soon realized that would not be 
      very fun as we like working with other developers. Quite frankly we want to protect our investment 
      in Nexus, and so we feel the GPL provides us adequate protection and still allows people to view,
      hack, and contribute back if they want to.

    <h2>What's with your amazingly boring logo for Nexus?</h2>
    <p>Our real logo for Nexus is what you see here.</p>
    
    <img src="http://nexus.sonatype.org/nexus-real-logo.png" width="500">       
    
    <h2>How do I use Nexus with a Socks server?</h2>
    <p>Add the following parameters to the wrapper.conf in /conf: (make sure the numbers are sequential with the existing list)<p>
    <ul><li>wrapper.java.additional.3=-DsocksProxyHost=[host]</li>
    <li>wrapper.java.additional.4=-DsocksProxyPort=[host]</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>You can read more about these JDK options <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/net/properties.html">here</a></p>
    
    <h2>Is Nexus available as a War?</h2>
    
    <p>Not yet. We feel that we are able to provide better product support and consistency by focusing on one container. We have chosen to embed a Jetty server inside our Plexus based container. We work closely with the Jetty team to provide the highest level of stability and performance that our clients demand. It will also allow us to do some very cool things in the future...<p>
    <p>If you wish to vote for a war, please vote on this <a href="http://issues.sonatype.org/browse/NEXUS-58">issue.</a></p>
    
    <h2>How can I integrate Nexus with Apache Httpd?</h2>
    
    <p>While we feel that the best performance for the system is achieved by accessing the embedded container directly, we also understand that some environments are highly integrated with Apache Httpd. There are several ways that Jetty can be tied to Apache. The Jetty team recommends using mod_proxy and you can read more about it <a href="http://docs.codehaus.org/display/JETTY/Configuring+mod_proxy">here</a>.</p>
    
    <p>A proper Mod_jk configuration is shown below:</p>
    <pre>    ProxyPass /nexus http://localhost:8081/nexus/
    ProxyPassReverse /nexus http://localhost:8081/nexus/
    ProxyPreserveHost On
</pre>

    <p>If you wish to host Nexus at the root of a system, the config might look like this:</p>
    <pre>&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;
    ServerName nexus.bogushost.com
    ServerAdmin webmaster@bogushost.com
    ProxyPass / http://localhost:8081/
    ProxyPassReverse / http://localhost:8081/
    ErrorLog logs/bogus/nexus/error.log
    CustomLog logs/bogus/nexus/access.log common
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;
</pre>
 
   <p><b>Note:</b> you must also edit the /conf/plexus.xml to change the context of Nexus from /nexus to / if you want to host at the root url. We currently do not support proxying from / to /nexus</p>
   
   <h2>How can I control nexus configurations in my environment?</h2>
   
   <p>Nexus will pull in some configuration data from environment variables, currently the following can be defined:</p>
   
   <ul>   
     <li>PLEXUS_NEXUS_WORK
       <ul>
         <li>The location of the nexus work directory, where nexus stores all of its configurations and repository contents.</li>
         <li>Defaults to $(basedir)/../sonatype-work/nexus</li>
       </ul>
     </li>
     <br>
     <li>PLEXUS_RUNTIME
       <ul>
         <li>The location of the nexus runtime directory</li>
         <li>Defaults to ${basedir}/runtime</li>
       </ul>
     </li>
     <br>
     <li>PLEXUS_APPS
       <ul>
         <li>The location of the nexus application directory</li>
         <li>Defaults to ${basedir}/runtime/apps</li>
       </ul>
     </li>
     <br>
     <li>PLEXUS_WEBAPP
       <ul>
         <li>The location of the nexus webapp directory</li>
         <li>Defaults to ${basedir}/runtime/apps/nexus/webapp</li>
       </ul>
     </li>
     <br>
     <li>PLEXUS_APPLICATION_HOST   
       <ul>
         <li>The host that the <a href="http://www.mortbay.org/jetty/" target="_new">Jetty Web Server</a> will be bound to</li>
         <li>Defaults to 0.0.0.0</li>
       </ul>
     </li>
     <br>
     <li>PLEXUS_APPLICATION_PORT
       <ul>
         <li>The port that the <a href="http://www.mortbay.org/jetty/" target="_new">Jetty Web Server</a> will be listening on</li>
         <li>Defaults to 8081</li>
       </ul>
     </li>
     <br>
     <li>PLEXUS_CONTEXT_PATH
       <ul>
         <li>The context path in <a href="http://www.mortbay.org/jetty/" target="_new">Jetty Web Server</a> that nexus webapp will be served at</li>
         <li>Defaults to /nexus</li>
       </ul>
     </li>
   </ul>
    <h2>I'm having trouble installing Nexus on Solaris!</h2>
    <p>We are aware of two potential issues that are specific to Solaris:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>There are some known incompatibilities with the version of tar provided by Solaris and the gzip tar format. If you are installing Nexus on Solaris, you must use the GNU tar application, or you will end up with corrupted files.
Please see this
<a href="http://sunsolarisadmin.blogspot.com/2007/03/how-to-install-gnu-tar-in-solaris.html">post</a> for more information.
</li>
      <li>It has been reported that the HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError option is not supported on some JVMs. The fix for this is to edit $nexus_home/conf/wrapper.conf to remove "wrapper.java.additional.3=-XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError". Be sure to renumber wrapper.java.additional.4 to .3.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2>What if my OS doesn't have JSW scripts in the Nexus bundle?</h2>
    <p>Nexus is a java application so it should be runnable on any OS with a supported jvm. JSW provides startup and monitoring of JVMs so they can be treated like a service. The bundle only contains the most common OS scripts, but more can be retrieved from the <a href="http://wrapper.tanukisoftware.org/doc/english/download.jsp">JSW</a> project directly.</p>
    
    <p>Alternatively, Nexus can be launched with a simple java command like:</p>
    <pre>java -Dbasedir=$nexus_home -Djava.io.tmpdir=$nexus_home/runtime/tmp
-Djava.library.path="./lib" -classpath"$nexus_home/lib/plexus-platform-jsw-1.4.jar;$nexus_home/conf/"
org.codehaus.plexus.classworlds.launcher.Launcher
</pre>
 <p>Note: the plexus-platform-jsw-xxx.jar version may change. You can find the exact file in $nexus_home/lib.</p>
 <h2>How can I extend or completely override the Nexus Security Model?</h2>
