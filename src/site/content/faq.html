    <h2>Is Nexus the kingpin of all Maven repository managers?</h2>
    <p>Yes. Is that a trick question?</p>        
    
    <h2>Is Nexus commercial?</h2>
    <p>
      There is a GPL licensed version of Nexus, and there will be commercially licensed version of Nexus. 
      The open source version is very robust and will be the basis of our commercial version. 
      The commercial version of Nexus will be the open source base combined with additional plugins 
      adding functionality desirable to many enterprise users. Sonatype will be providing professional support 
      for both the open source and commercial versions of Nexus.
    </p>      
    
    <h2>Why are you releasing Nexus under the GPL?</h2>
    <p>
      There are a lot of Maven people involved at Sonatype, and normally we have used a BSD/MIT/Apache license 
      so some people have asked us why, oh why, did you choose the GPL? The answer is that we originally 
      intended there only be a commercial version of Nexus, but we soon realized that would not be 
      very fun as we like working with other developers. Quite frankly we want to protect our investment 
      in Nexus, and so we feel the GPL provides us adequate protection and still allows people to view,
      hack, and contribute back if they want to.

    <h2>What's with your amazingly boring logo for Nexus?</h2>
    <p>Our real logo for Nexus is what you see here.</p>

    <h2>How do I use Nexus with a Socks server?</h2>
    <p>Add the following parameters to the wrapper.conf in /conf: (make sure the numbers are sequential with the existing list)<p>
    <ul><li>wrapper.java.additional.3=-DsocksProxyHost=[host]</li>
    <li>wrapper.java.additional.4=-DsocksProxyPort=[host]</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>You can read more about these JDK options <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/net/properties.html">here</a></p>
    
    <h2>Is Nexus available as a War?</h2>
    
    <p>No. We feel that we are able to provide better product support and consistency by focusing on one container. We have chosen to embed a Jetty server inside our Plexus based container. We work closely with the Jetty team to provide the highest level of stability and performance that our clients demand. It will also allow us to do some very cool things in the future...<p>
    
    <h2>How can I integrate Nexus with Apache Httpd?</h2>
    
    <p>While we feel that the best performance for the system is achieved by accessing the embedded container directly, we also understand that some environments are highly integrated with Apache Httpd. There are several ways that Jetty can be tied to Apache. The Jetty team recommends using mod_proxy and you can read more about it <a href="http://docs.codehaus.org/display/JETTY/Configuring+mod_proxy">here</a>. We currently do not support the mod_ajp connection as it requires additional configuration to the embedded container. If demand is high enough, we will make this configurable in the future.</p>
