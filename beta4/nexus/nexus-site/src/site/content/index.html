      Nexus is a powerful and robust Maven repository manager, created to provide reliable access to artifacts
      required for development and provisioning. Maven's central repository has always served as a great convenience for
      users of Maven, but it has always been recommended to maintain your own repositories to ensure stability within 
      your organization. Nexus greatly simplifies the maintenance of your own internal repositories and access 
      to external repositories. With Nexus you can completely control access to, and deployment of, every artifact
      in your organization from a single location.

    <h1>Getting Started</h1>
    <p>
      The best way to get started with Nexus is to read the chapter about Nexus in 
      <a href="http://www.sonatype.com/book/reference/repository-manager.html">Maven: The Definitive Guide</a>. It will
      give you a brief introduction to Maven repository managers, why Nexus kicks ass, and how to install it for your
      own software develop needs.
    </p>

    <h1>Features</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Runs out-of-the-box. Unpack it and go!</li>      
      <li>Rich UI using the amazing <a href="http://extjs.com">ExtJS</a> library.</li>
      <li>Full REST APIs made possible using <a href="http://restlet.org">Restlet.</a></li>      
      <li>Full integration with Eclipse using <a href="http://m2eclipse.sonatype.org">m2eclipse</a>.</li>
      <li>Repository RSS feeds for recently deployed and cached artifacts.</li>
      <li>Full indexing and searching. This also includes searching proxied repositories by integrating 
        Nexus indices hosted by the remotely proxied repositories.</li>      
      <li>Tool to convert Proximity configurations to Nexus configurations.</li>
      <li>No database required. Nexus uses the filesystem with Lucene and that's it. Amazing things are still possible.</li>
      <li>Snapshot cleanup</li>
      <li>Advanced Repository Proxying and Hosting</li>
      <ul>      
        <li>On-the-fly repository metadata correction: if a proxied repository contains snapshots and releases Nexus 
          removes removes the versions from the metadata that don't match the type or repository you
          have configured.</li>
        <li>Logical groups: Nexus allows you to logically represent any number of proxied, or hosted 
          repositories as a single group which accessible via a unified URL.</li>
        <li>Artifact request optimization based on groupId or artifactId: You can configure Nexus to not
          look in certain places for certain artifacts. For example you wouldn't need to search Maven's 
          central repository for your own organization's artifacts.</li>
        <li>Ability to present and proxy Maven 2.x repositories to Maven 1.x clients: this means that you can service
          all users of Maven 1.x and Maven 2.x in your organization using Nexus.</li>
        <li>Intelligent NFC (not found cache), with the ability to persist NFC cache to disk.</li>
        <li>Ability to check remote peer availability and make a Nexus proxy "offline" automatically 
        (prevent any reach attempt toward unreachable remote repo) HTTP proxy and connection settings may be set 
        globally or per repository. This means Nexus is able to use more than one HTTP proxy simultaneously.</li>
        <li>Flexible Repository aggregation into multiple logical views without duplicating storage on disk.</li>
       </ul>
    </ul>
      <!-->
      <li>Stand-alone security model with LDAP support</li>
      <li>Fully compliant WebDAV support</li>
