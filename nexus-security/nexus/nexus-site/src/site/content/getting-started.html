      The best way to get started with Nexus is to read the chapter about Nexus in 
      <a href="http://www.sonatype.com/book/reference/repository-manager.html">Maven: The Definitive Guide</a>. It will
      give you a brief introduction to Maven repository managers, why Nexus kicks ass, how to install it and get it running.
